While they are great served as an antipasti, they make a great main course as well, especially when looking for a comforting meal the whole family can enjoy using ingredients you likely already have.

In this recipe, we pair our basil gnocchi with our Rustic Tomato Basil Sauce, but whichever sauce you have on hand will work wonderfully.

 
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>4 medium-sized russet potatoes</li>
 	<li>1 egg</li>
 	<li>1 cup flour</li>
 	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup torn basil leaves</li>
 	<li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
 	<li>1 jar Lucini Rustic Tomato Basil Sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and puncture the potatoes with a fork. Bake them until they are soft to the touch, about 40 -50 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Once the potatoes are baked, immediately cut them in half and scoop the insides into a potato ricer. Place the riced potatoes onto a work surface and spread them into a 1-inch thick layer and let them cool to room temperature.</li>
 	<li>Once cooled, push the potatoes into a mound and make a well at the center. Place the egg, salt, and pepper in the well and knead, adding in the flour, cheese, and basil as you go. Knead until the mixture comes together and is smooth and tacky. Use more flour if your mixture isn't coming together, but you want to use as little flour as possible.</li>
 	<li>Roll the dough into a log and cut into 5-6 sections. Lightly flour your work surface and roll one of the sections out until its 1/2 inch thick. Cut into 1/2 inch pieces, repeat with the remaining sections.</li>
 	<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. While waiting for the water to boil, heat the Lucini Rustic Tomato Basil Sauce in a large skillet.</li>
 	<li>When the water is boiling, place the gnocchi in the pot and boil until the pieces float to the top, about one minute.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
1.<strong> Make the meatballs:</strong> In a small skillet, heat the <a href=""https://shop.lucini.com/Premium-Select-Extra-Virgin-Olive-Oil/p/LUC-012502&amp;c=Lucini@OliveOils"">extra virgin olive oil</a> over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute more. Set aside and let cool to room temperature.

2. In a medium bowl, combine the cooled onion mixture with the Parmesan, parsley, oregano, egg and ground beef; mix until combined. Add the bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper and then mix again.

3. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease it generously with nonstick cooking spray.

4. With a spoon, scoop the meat mixture into 1-inch balls and arrange them evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the meatballs are fully cooked, 20 to 25 minutes. Pour the <a href=""https://shop.lucini.com/100-Organic-Sauces/c/Lucini@Sauces@Organic"">tomato sauce</a> over the meatballs, toss to coat and then return the pan to the oven until the sauce is bubbly, 10 minutes more.

5. <strong>Make the polenta:</strong> In a medium pot, bring the milk and 3 cups water to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk in the polenta and cook, whisking occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the polenta absorbs all of the liquid, 15 to 20 minutes.

7. Divide the polenta among four plates and then spoon the meatballs over the polenta. Garnish each serving with parsley and Parmesan. Serve immediately.

387000303755,what-does-the-color-of-olive-oil-tell-us,MERGE,What Does The Color of Olive Oil Tell Us?,lucidfusion,"<h2>The Color Of Olive Oil</h2>
The color of olive oil can tell us many things about its flavor, origins, and age. Here at <a href=""https://www.lucini.com/"">Lucini Italia</a>, we are passionate about sharing our love for handcrafted, gourmet foods inspired by the culinary traditions of Italy—from our handcrafted sauces and artisan vinegars, to our truly exceptional gourmet <a href=""https://www.lucini.com/our-products/category/extra-virgin-olive-oil/"">olive oil</a>. Let’s take a look at what the color of olive oil can tell us.
<h2>Age</h2>
Olives are green when they are young, and get darker as they age from purple to black. According to Richard Gawel, Australian olive oil expert, “Olives picked early in the season tend to make green colored oil as they contain higher levels of chlorophyll. Olives harvested late in the season will typically produce more golden colored oils due to a higher level of natural occurring levels of carotene-like substances. Both oils may be technically equivalent in quality but very different in style.”
<h2>Flavor</h2>
There are some exceptions to this, but in general, golden or yellow colored olive oils will have a buttery and mild flavor, while green oils typically are more peppery and robust. Stronger oils are best suited for stronger foods like red meats or hearty soups, while milder oils tend to taste better with mild dishes such as fish, rice or pasta. Both green and golden oils work well for dipping bread; it’s simply a matter of personal preference.
<h2>What About Quality?</h2>
It’s important to note that color does not reflect the quality of the extra virgin olive oil. The color is no indication of an oil’s quality—it simply reflects things such as when the olives were harvested, how the oil was produced. In fact, color has so little to do with the quality of olive oil, that judges in olive oil tasting contests are required to taste the oils from blue cups to ensure they do not misjudge an oil based on its color!

387000336523,olive-oil-fats,MERGE,Olive Oil Fats,lucidfusion,"EVOO, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is a staple in kitchens across the globe. Not only is it a wonderful cooking oil, its versatility makes it a top ingredient in dishes from appetizers and desserts, to dressings and dips—and everything in between. On top of this, EVOO is chock full of health benefits—including high levels of antioxidants and healthy fats. Let’s break down the classification of fats out there and discover the amazing benefits of olive oil fats.
<h2>Trans Fats</h2>
<a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-trans-fats-are-bad"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trans fats</a> are man-made fats that are the most unhealthy of all fats. Trans fats are highly processed, and they are created when hydrogen molecules are added to natural liquid vegetable oils to produce a solid oil. They are labeled as “Partially hydrogenated oils” on packaging ingredient lists. Trans fats have been known to cause many health issues, including cancer, obesity, heart disease, stroke, and other serious complications.
<h2>Saturated Fats</h2>
<a href=""https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Saturated fats</a> are not as bad for our health as trans fats, but they often increase bad cholesterol levels, which can cause problems down the road. These fats are fairly common, and are found in foods like red meat, coconut oil, and dairy products including milk, cheese and butter. Saturated fats can be eaten in moderation (about 10% of daily caloric intake) without any cause for concern.
<h2>Unsaturated Fats</h2>
These good fats are important to consume for a healthy lifestyle. Within the family of <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/unsaturated_fat.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">unsaturated fats</a>, there are two types of fats: monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Let’s take a look at both.
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Monounsaturated Fat</strong>—EVOO is comprised of mostly monounsaturated fat. This is one of the best, most healthiest fats for the human body. It helps decrease levels of bad cholesterol and increase levels of good cholesterol. It also helps break down plaque in the arteries, making it an excellent oil for cardiovascular health. In addition to these benefits, it also helps the body balance blood sugar levels, which is helpful for those with obesity, diabetes, PCOS, and other conditions related to metabolic health.</li>
 	<li>

<h2>Charcuterie Board Tips</h2>
Charcuterie boards are meant to be aesthetically pleasing all while appealing to contrasting flavors. You should make sure that the board balances the colors as well as the flavors (such as sweet and salty).You’ll also want to make sure to add equal amounts of each ingredient as to not overpower one food group over the other and to create the perfect texture combinations. For an ideal board, we recommend picking 2-3 items from each of the categories below:

Flavored olive oil is a terrific way to add a bit of a flavorful kick to your everyday olive oil. If you’ve ever wondered how to make infused <a href=""https://www.lucini.com/our-products/category/extra-virgin-olive-oil/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">olive oil</a> of your own, we’ll be glad to teach you! Here are three of our favorite types of flavored olive oil as well as how to make them (using our own olive oil as a base). And don’t worry – they’re as simple as can be!
<h2>Chili Olive Oil</h2>
If you’re looking to spice up your olive oil, we recommend trying some chili olive oil. To make it, you’ll just need a few teaspoons of dried, crushed red pepper flakes. Combine these with olive oil into a saucepan and then cook it at 180 degrees Fahrenheit for about five minutes. Let it cool at room temperature for a few hours afterward. After cooling, transfer the oil to a bottle, preferably with the help of a funnel.
<h2>Italian Herb Olive Oil</h2>
Not only is this Italian herb olive oil blend healthy and flavorful, but it’s also incredibly simple to make. You’ll need a handful of ingredients that include six leaves of basil, two sprigs of oregano, two sprigs of rosemary, and two sprigs of thyme. All you need to do is combine all these ingredients into a bottle and then, with the usage of a funnel, pour about 1.5 cups of olive oil in.
<h2>Rosemary-Infused Olive Oil</h2>
While the last recipe included rosemary, this is for those who want to go all out with that taste! All you’ll need is three fresh rosemary sprigs and about half of a cup of olive oil. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan and then cook it at a low heat of 180 degrees Fahrenheit for about five minutes. Remove it and let it cool at room temperature. Afterward, transfer the sprigs to a bottle and then add the oil to it.

387000598667,spanish-italian-olive-oils-taste-the-difference,MERGE,Spanish & Italian Olive Oils: Taste the Difference,lucidfusion,"<h2>Lucini Italia Co. - Spanish and Italian Olive Oils: Taste the Difference</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're a fan of olives or olive oil, you probably already know that flavors change a lot depending on the quality of the oil you use. If you shop for authentic olive oils from a trusted source like Lucini Italia Company, you know you are getting the finest, high-quality ingredients available. Whether you’re looking for balsamic oils or gourmet quality EVOO, Lucini Italia Co. has what you need to create a culinary masterpiece.</span>
<h2>Spanish Olive Oil Characteristics</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While it's similar in thickness to Italian oil, Spanish olives tend to produce an oil that is much more yellow in appearance than their cousins. This difference is attributed to the temperate climate in Spain making the olives grow with characteristics their Italian counterparts don't acquire. Over time, this produces a change in the presentation of the olive, producing a unique varietal that can be cultivated as its own type of olive. The flavor is distinctly fruity and nutty as well, as the varieties of Spanish olive that are most popular are sweeter and more robustly savory than the Italian oils most people are more familiar with.</span>
<h2>Contrasting Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil Characteristics</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Italian olives are the ones most Americans think of when they think of olives generally, because the common varieties of canned olive are frequently Italian, as are the most prevalent brands of olive oil at every price point. Green varieties are distinctly bitter, often with a tart secondary taste, and when it comes to eating the olives whole, people tend to be sharply divided about the experience. Very few people dislike the grassy, herbal aroma this translates into when it's pressed into oil, though. The pungent aroma and strong flavors of Italian oils contribute to the unique taste of Italian sauces that are the core of most of the </span><a href=""https://www.lucini.com/recipes/category/main-courses/baked-mezzi-rigatoni-with-parmesan-herb-sauce-and-sweet-italian-sausage/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">popular dishes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from the country.</span>
<h2><b>Get Authentic Taste From Italian Oils</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're cooking an Italian dish, there's a good chance a Spanish olive oil will make the flavor a little bit different from what you expect it to be. The best way to get strong, predictable Italian flavors is to use an authentic Italian extra virgin olive oil like the varieties from the </span><a href=""https://www.lucini.com/products/premium-select-extra-virgin-olive-oil/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lucini Italia Co</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

Eating Italian food should be an experience – not a means to an end – and that includes cocktails as well! For your pleasure, allow us to provide you with the recipes for five of the most iconic Italian cocktails out there.
<h2>Martini</h2>
The martini cocktail is one of the most well-known and iconic alcoholic drinks. Its exact origin is unknown and it’s speculated that it’s been around for over 150 years! Because of its longevity, it unsurprisingly has plenty of variations, including the dry martini, the dirty martini, and the perfect martini. Whatever you choose, don’t forget the olive!

3 oz. Gin
0.5 oz. Dry Vermouth

Filla shaker three-fourths full with ice. Add Gin and Vermouth. Cover and vigorously shake until condensation forms on the outside of the shaker. Strain into a martini glass. Garnish with olives.
<h2>Bellini</h2>
The Bellini pairs sweet white peach purée with Champagne for a refreshingly light, bubbly beverage. This drink is most commonly a staple at brunch or enjoyed as a summer aperitif.

1 oz. white peach purée
3 oz. chilled Champagne

Pour white peach purée into a Champagne glass and top with Champagne. Garnish with a fresh peach slice.
<h2>Rossini</h2>
Although similar to the Bellini, a Rossini swaps strawberries for white peaches and Prosecco for Champagne. This beverage is best enjoyed in place of Mimosas at brunch, an aperitif, or with dessert.

1 oz. puréed strawberries
3 oz. chilled Prosecco

Pour strawberry purée into a champagne glass and top with Prosecco. Garnish with a fresh strawberry.
<h2>Aperol Spritz</h2>
Aperol Spritz, also known as a Spritz Veneziano or just Spritz, is an Italian wine-based cocktail that is commonly served as an aperitif. This golden orange cocktail is not too sweet and just the right amount of bubbly for a refreshing finish.

2 oz. Aperol
3 oz. Prosecco
A splash of Seltzer

Fill a wine glass with ice, then add the Aperol, Prosecco, and Seltzer. Garnish with an orange slice for added color.
<h2>Godfather</h2>
Thought to be named after the popular movie, The Godfather, this surprisingly smooth drink gained its popularity in the ’70s as a nightcap. The Godfather is typically served on the rocks but can also be enjoyed neat in an old fashioned glass. Alternatively, if you don’t feel like having scotch, substitute vodka to make a Godmother.

¼ oz. Amaretto
2 oz. Scotch Whiskey
Fill a mixing glass ⅔ full with ice. Add the scotch whiskey and amaretto. Stir until chilled. Strain into an ice-filled old fashioned glass.

As pasta experts, we’re not only thrilled to share with you our organic pasta sauce, but we’re glad to share our advice with you to take your pasta to the next level. Here are five easy suggestions that you should consider trying out the next time you make pasta.
<h2>Make It Yourself</h2>
The best way to take your pasta to the next level is to simply make it yourself from scratch. Nothing compares with the taste of homemade pasta and by doing it all yourself, you’ll be sure to have the freedom to experiment with it in different ways until you get just the right result that you’re looking for. It’s not even as difficult as it seems! Even if you don’t have a pasta machine, a heavy rolling pin will get the job done.
<h2>Shape it up</h2>
Did you know that there are over several hundred different pasta shapes? It may come as a surprise to most because most traditional pasta dishes are made with the spaghetti noodle, but why not break that trend and switch up the shape of your pasta! There’s plenty to choose from and it can definitely give your pasta a more unique feel.
<h2>Stuff It</h2>
If you’re going to be making ravioli, tortellini, or any other type of pasta that can be stuffed, why not experiment? There are plenty of unique ways that you can stuff pasta – don’t just limit yourself to the basics! Some less-used suggestions can include lobster, truffles, egg yolk, and fruit. Or anything really - the possibilities are practically endless!
<h2>Add Color to It</h2>
Another suggestion is to change up your pasta’s appearance. With the help of additional ingredients, you can modify the color of your pasta from its natural, bland yellow appearance to something more original. For example, you can use the flavoring of high-quality pasta sauce to give your pasta a reddish appearance or you can use spinach to turn it green. It’ll certainly give your pasta a more vibrant look!
<h2>Try Different Flavors</h2>
While adding color to it may make a visual difference, changing the flavor can dramatically change the entire dish! This can include herbs that you add into the dough or even the premium tomato sauce that you use. Here at Lucini, we offer our own organic tomato sauce to give your pasta an authentic Italian taste. It may be the missing ingredient that you’ve been looking for!
<h2>Contact Lucini Italia Co. Today!</h2>
Experimenting with different flavors and colors is a great way to take your pasta to the next level.

<h2><b>The Secret Ingredient </b></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1275"" src=""https://www.lucini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LUC-AugustTomatoHarvest_062919_226-1-1400x933.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""427"">

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The secret ingredient inside of our tomato sauces truly comes down to the fresh tomatoes we use. The tomatoes in Lucini sauces are harvested from small fields, which allows for a more homogeneous ripeness. Then, they’re sorted to ensure that only the best berries are included in each jar.  </span>
<h2><b>The Cooked-Once Technique </b></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1276"" src=""https://www.lucini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LUC-AugustTomatoHarvest_062919_194-1400x933.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""427"">

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Lucini we use a cooked-once technique, which is a rare process in the industry that allows for fresh ingredients to maintain their garden-fresh taste. Most supermarket brands use a cooked-twice process where the tomatoes are harvested and processed, then cooked again at a later date when it’s time to mix the other ingredients together. This attributes to the heavy and savory taste profile that is found in most jarred sauces. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By using the cooked-once technique we are able to bottle the fresh flavor that comes from freshly harvested, super-high quality tomatoes. It also means that we don’t need to add acids like lactic acid or citric acid back in. What makes our tomato sauce taste so fresh and delicious is that it’s just that-fresh! That’s the Lucini touch. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're a fan of authentic Italian food or even just Mediterranean dishes in general, you should know about Lucini Italia Company. We are a company dedicated to providing the highest quality ingredients to professional and home chefs alike. Founded on principles that date back to old world Italy, Lucini Italia Co. provides key ingredients, like balsamic and fruit-infused vinegar, for gourmet dishes.</span>
<h2><b>What Makes a Balsamic?</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The general term balsamic or balsamic vinegar is not protected, so any vinegar that uses the process involved in making it can carry the label internationally. To qualify, the base of the vinegar has to be grape must— whole pressed grapes complete with skin, juice, seeds, and stem. While balsam is a thing, the sticky plant resin has no role in the creation of balsamic vinegar. It's just a linguistic similarity. Traditional red wine vinegar varieties use the strained juice, fermented into wine and then from there processed into vinegar. Balsamic uses the grape must, creating a vinegar that is distinctly sweet, incredibly flavorful, and unique in its characteristics. While balsamic vinegar is not an origin designation with any level of international legal protection, there are three varieties that do carry that distinction. Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, the premium blend that is most accessible globally, is produced exclusively in Modena and Reggio Emilia and carries a protected status. It's made from a mixture of grape must and red wine vinegar, and it's the flavor you are probably most familiar with.</span>
<h2><b>Unique Balsamic Blends and Traditional Varieties</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're lucky enough to try one of the two traditional premium balsamic vinegar varieties that enjoy protected status as geographic labels, you'll find they are made from pure grape must, making them thinner than the more common premium variety. In addition to those varieties, which are made with grape varietals historic to their regions of origin and in those locations, there is a wide world of fruit-infused balsamic vinegar available at accessible price points for those looking to add a flavorful twist to their Mediterranean dishes.</span>

At Lucini Italia, we love the art of Italian cooking, and we’re committed to spreading the flavors and foods of Italy. One such Italian tradition is<a href=""https://www.livitaly.com/art-of-italian-barbecue/""> grigliata</a>.  This term translates to “grill out” and refers to the centuries-old tradition of cooking food over an open fire.
<h2><strong>Opting Outdoors</strong></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1253 size-medium"" src=""https://www.lucini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/20180523_KU_E3_Morels_0740_retouched-333x500.jpg"" alt="""" width=""333"" height=""500"">
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Photo by <a href=""http://www.arthurstreetkitchen.com/"">Arthur Street Kitchen</a></p>
In the summer months, just as the weather begins to warm, Italians open their windows and head outside. It’s not uncommon to see cafés move tables outdoors so that patrons can enjoy the sunshine. Impromptu barbecues with families and friends also take place, though they look a little different than the barbecues we’re used to here in the US.
<h2><strong>Italian Barbecues</strong></h2>
In grigliata cooking, Italians focus on simple foods whose flavors are enhanced by the method of <a href=""https://www.eataly.com/us_en/magazine/culture/italian-grilled/"">cooking over an open fire</a>. Rather than slathering meats in barbecue sauce, they focus on selecting high-quality meats and using simple marinades that allow the natural flavors to shine through. At the very heart of Italian grilling recipes are fresh vegetables, proteins, herbs, olive oil, and lemon juice. Even seasonings are kept simple, with most grilled meats finished off with a pinch of sea salt and a drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.
<h2><strong>The Menu</strong></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1250"" src=""https://www.lucini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LUC-JulyGrilling_061119_143-1400x933.jpg"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""427"">

Along with grilled meats and seafood, many classic Italian staples can be made on the grill. This includes bruschetta and pizza, and even winter staples like eggplant parmesan. Along with appetizers and entrees making the grigliata menu, desserts are made on the grill as well. Peaches and other stone fruits are a popular grilled dessert during the summer months, and are often paired with ricotta and a drizzle of balsamic.
<h2><strong>Grilling Tips</strong></h2>
If you’re ready to start grilling the Italian way, it’s important to have an excellent extra virgin olive oil on hand. Olive oil is often overlooked for grilling because it is said to have a low smoke point, but that simply isn’t true. High-quality extra virgin olive oil like our Lucini Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil has a smoke point of over 400 degrees. Olive oil is an important grilling staple from start to finish. It is great for building marinades, preventing sticking during the grilling process, and <a href=""https://www.thespruceeats.com/italian-grilling-335802"">as a flavorful finish</a> once your food has been grilled.

387000860811,the-cultivation-of-olives-in-argentina,MERGE,The Cultivation of Olives in Argentina,lucidfusion,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Olives and olive oil are instantly recognizable signifiers of Italian food and culture – but Italy isn't the only country where olives have played an important role in agricultural development. Nearly 12,000 kilometers away on the other side of the Equator, the South American country of Argentina has also had a love affair with the olive tree – but the history of Argentine olive cultivation is a much more checkered one. At Lucini Italia, we're passionate about crafting the finest </span><a href=""https://shop.lucini.com/Extra-Virgin-Olive-Oil/c/Lucini@OliveOils""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">extra virgin olive oils</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and other gourmet Italian ingredients, so we wanted to delve into the tumultuous history Argentine olive cultivation. </span>
<h2>From Colonial Decrees to Modern Monetary Motives</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Initially, olive trees came to Argentina with its colonization by Spain in the 16th century. Olive trees grow here between 35 and 45 degrees of latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres, and Argentina happens to be situated perfectly for the cultivation of this Mediterranean species. Accordingly, the olive trees brought from Europe flourished in Argentina, to the point where Spanish king Charles III feared that the Argentine olive oil market posed too much competition to Spain's own production. Accordingly, Charles III ordered a cessation of olive oil production in Argentina and that all the olive trees be cut down. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This could have been the end of Argentina's olive tree story, but some farmers asked to keep one or two trees alive for their own personal consumption, and some stories even say one olive grove, located in Arauco in the region of La Rioja, was kept alive by Doña Expectación de la Fuente de Avilla. In any case, some olive trees survived the king's order, enough to sustain a wild, breeding population. Over time, this population adapted to the unique climate and soil of Argentina, eventually evolving into its own distinct, indigenous species: the Arauco olive. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Olive cultivation stayed in the rear of Argentina's agricultural industry until the 1930s, when a government campaign to encourage cultivation eventually led to the cultivation of over 7 million trees. However, in the 60s, agricultural turned towards wine grapes, and an anti-olive oil consumption campaign lead to more than 20,000 hectares of olive trees being uprooted, reducing the population by over 50%. It wasn't until the 1990s when global olive oil prices began to rise and European production began to fall, that Argentina's olive production industry started to heat up again. Today, Argentina boasts a sizable olive cultivation industry and produces many varieties of extra virgin olive oil from both the indigenous Arauco olive and other varietals. </span>

But beyond spreading the flavors and foods of Italy, we're proud to be a part of continuing Italian cultural heritage, as well. The olive tree has long been synonymous with the sprawling landscapes of old-world Italy and the greater Mediterranean, and the olive has been an important symbol since the time of the ancient Greeks. So to help celebrate this marvelous plant, we want to dive into all the things that olives can symbolize.</span>
<h2>The Olive Branch: a Symbol of Pace (Peace)</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps the most well-known symbolic connotation for the olive is peace. The olive tree, or more specifically an olive branch, is a symbol of peace and friendship dating back to ancient Greek mythology. Myth tells us that Zeus held a contest between Poseidon and Athena for control over Athens, asking both to make an offering. Poseidon smashed his trident against a rock, producing a spring, while Athena called forth an olive tree with soft, silver-green leaves and an abundance of fruit. Zeus declared Athena the winner, and the olive tree has been an important Greek mythological symbol ever since. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The olive branch reappears as a symbol of peace several more times in Greco-Roman mythology. The Roman poet Virgil uses the olive branch as a signifier of peace in the Aeneid, and Roman envoys used olive branches as tokens of peace during the Pax Romana. Furthermore, while Mars was the Roman god of war, he was also known as Mars Pacifer, or Mars the bringer of peace. Some Roman coins depicted Mars Pacifer as holding an olive branch, demonstrating its symbolic connotations of peace. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This symbolism continues on to the modern day. The Great Seal of the United States features America's national bird, the bald eagle, holding a clutch of arrows in one talon, symbolizing war, and an olive branch in the other, symbolizing peace. The branch appears on the flag of Cyprus as a peace symbol as well, and the peace connotation also exists in many Arab folk traditions. </span>
<h2>Order Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil Online</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The olive tree and olive branch have been historic symbols of peace and goodwill for thousands of years, and today, we can all enjoy the real-life incarnation of this important symbolic plant in the form of traditional Italian ingredients like extra virgin olive oil.

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Add the chopped onion, parsley, and garlic to the bowl of a </span><a href=""http://amzn.to/2BHKxeG""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">food processor</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Pulse a few time to finely mince all ingredients.</span>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Add the spices, salt, and pepper and pulse a few more times, scraping down the sides as needed to ensure an even distribution.</span></li>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Roll approximately 1 heaping tablespoon of the turkey mixture into a meatball and set aside. Repeat with the remaining turkey mixture until you have approximately 18 uniformly sized balls. (The meatballs will be very soft and moist at this stage, and you might want to lightly coat your hands with a little extra virgin olive oil to prevent the meat from sticking too much.)</span></li>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remove the browned meatballs using the tongs and set aside on a plate. Repeat with the remaining batches until all of the meatballs are browned. </span></li>

Recipe Servings: approximately 1 pound of pasta, 4 to 6 serving
Recipe Preparation Time: 1 to 6 hours
Recipe Cook Time: 10 minutes
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<em><strong>Handmade Tagliolini:</strong></em>
1 cup 100% Organic White Whole Wheat Flour, plus more for dusting <em>(we recommend King Arthur)</em>
1 cup Durum Wheat Semolina Flour <em>(we recommend Bob's Red Mill No. 1)</em>
½ cup + 2 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon Lucini Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil®

<em><strong>Final Dish:</strong></em>
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 25.5-ounce jar Lucini® Organic Tuscan Marinara Sauce
Your favorite pasta toppings: fresh basil, Parmigiano-reggiano cheese, black pepper, Lucini Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil®
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<em><strong>Handmade Tagliolini:</strong></em>
Place the flours in a food processor. Pulse five times to combine. With processor on, slowly stream in the water and olive oil and process until the dough comes together in a semi-cohesive ball, approximately 1 minute.

Remove dough from food processor and knead for approximately 5 minutes or until a smooth, cohesive ball forms. (Dust dough lightly with flour if it sticks while kneading.) Press dough ball down to flatten into a disk shape, approximately 7-inches in diameter. Wrap disk in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.

Roll out dough on your pasta machine to #4 thickness, dusting dough with flour to prevent sticking as needed.

Process dough through tagliolini (or spaghetti) attachment, again, dusting dough with flour to prevent sticking as needed.

<em><strong>Final Dish:
</strong></em>Bring a large pot of water and 2 tablespoons of kosher salt to a rolling boil.

Add the jar of Lucini Organic Tuscan Marinara Sauce to a large nonstick or stainless steel sauté pan. Place over low heat and stir occasionally until sauce is warmed through.

Add fresh pasta to the boiling water and stir gently. Cook for approximately 20 to 30 seconds, until al dente.

Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain pasta. Add drained pasta to the sauté pan with the warmed Tuscan Marinara sauce. Stir gently to combine, adding some of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce as needed.

Divide pasta in bowls and add your favorite toppings such as fresh basil, freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, cracked black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.",,main-courses|recipes|view-all,REPLACE,2020-07-09 12:13:17 -0700,2020-08-26 08:20:07 -0700,TRUE,2017-05-25 07:13:38 -0700,0,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0279/3655/5147/articles/14050b4f-luc-pasta-dish_101416_0132-scaled.jpg?v=1598455207,1707,2560,,60969123979,content,content,no,,,,2020-06-09 10:41:07 -0700,2021-04-29 08:29:28 -0700,Handmade Tagliolini with Organic Tuscan Marinara ,Meta description coming soon.,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,[],FALSE

Recipe Servings: 6 portions
Recipe Preparation Time: 0 minutes
Recipe Cook Time: 20 minutes
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
1 cup butter
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1 cup whole toasted almonds, skin on
2 cups flour
2 tablespoons sliced almonds, skin on, slightly toasted
2 cups strawberries, cut in wedges
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon lime zest
1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/4 cups heavy (whipping) cream
Pulp of 1/2 vanilla bean
2 tablespoons Lucini 10 Year Gran Riserva Balsamico
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup fresh spinach leaves
<h3>Instructions</h3>
To make shortbread, cream butter and 6 tablespoons sugar until light, fluffy and almost white. In food processor with metal blade, puree whole almonds 2 minutes until very fine; add to butter mixture along with flour and pinch of salt. Mix until just blended.

Roll out dough, between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, until about 1/8-inch thick. Lay shortcake dough, still covered in plastic wrap, on sheet pan and refrigerate 30 minutes. Remove plastic wrap, place dough on cutting board and cut into at least 18 3- by 2-inch rectangles. Place on parchment-lined sheet pan and lightly press 4 or 5 almond slices into each rectangle. Bake at 350 degrees 15 - 20 minutes, until golden brown.

*Simple Syrup: Bring 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Cool. Note: use leftover syrup to make mixed drinks or sauce for plain cake, custard, fresh fruit mixture.

Basil Syrup (yield scant 1/4 cup): Submerge 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves and 1/4 cup fresh spinach leaves in boiling water 10 seconds. Remove from pan and plunge immediately into ice water. Squeeze any excess water from leaves and chop coarsely. In food processor, puree with 1/4 cup simple syrup 3 minutes, until color is bright green. Strain through a fine (mesh) sieve. Store in refrigerator.

Toss strawberry wedges with Simple Syrup and lime zest. Set aside. Whisk creme fraiche, heavy cream and remaining sugar with vanilla pulp until soft peaks form.

To assemble, place a small dollop of vanilla cream in center of each of six dessert plates. Place a piece of almond shortbread over cream. Spoon a large dollop of vanilla cream on top and cover with a second piece of shortbread.

Continue the process to make three shortbread layers. Spoon some strawberries around napoleon. Drizzle Lucini® 10 Year Aged Gran Riserva Balsamico and basil syrup around strawberries and sprinkle with basil.

<h3>Recipe Summary</h3>
Recipe Servings: 6 portions
Recipe Preparation Time: 15 minutes
Recipe Cook Time: 25 minutes
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul style=""margin: 0; padding: 0 20px;"">
 	<li>1 cup sugar</li>
 	<li>Zest of 4 lemons</li>
 	<li>4 extra large eggs, room temperature</li>
 	<li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
 	<li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
 	<li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
 	<li>3 tablespoons whole milk, room temperature</li>
 	<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

 	<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped rosemary</li>
 	<li>½ cup lightly-toasted pine nuts</li>
 	<li>3 tablespoons cornmeal, medium grind</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Preheat oven to 350°F, or 325°F for a convection oven.

In a small bowl combine the sugar and lemon zest, pressing the two firmly together with the back of a wooden spoon to release the zest’s oil. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine eggs and lemon-zest sugar. Mix on medium speed with whip attachment until thick, about 5 to 6 minutes. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, rosemary, and salt. In a separate bowl combine the milk, lemon juice, melted butter, and olive oil. Turn the mixer to low speed and alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk mixture into the thick egg mixture until fully incorporated.

Lightly spray a 10×10 inch cake pan with cooking spray and dust with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal. Fill the cake pan with the mixture, sprinkle with the lightly toasted pine nuts, and top with the remaining cornmeal.

Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when tested. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped crème fraiche.

<h3>Recipe Summary</h3>
Recipe Servings: 8 portions
Recipe Preparation Time: 0 minutes
Recipe Cook Time: 50 minutes
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul style=""margin: 0; padding: 0 20px;"">
 	<li>6 kumquats, cut in half</li>
 	<li>2/3 cup Lucini® Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil®</li>
 	<li>1 orange</li>
 	<li>1 lemon</li>
 	<li>1 mango, peeled, pitted, diced small</li>
 	<li>1 cup flour</li>
 	<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
 	<li>4 eggs</li>
 	<li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
 	<li>3/4 cup blanched and toasted almonds, finely ground</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Place the kumquats and Lucini® Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil® in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Continue simmering for 3 minutes and then remove from the heat. Let steep for 1 hour. Strain the fruit from the Lucini® Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil®. Reserve the oil and discard the fruit.

Place the (uncut) orange and lemon in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer for 30 minutes. Drain and let cool. Cut off the stem end of the citrus fruits and then cut in half. Scoop the pulp and seeds from the lemon and discard. Finely mince the lemon rind.

Squeeze out as much of the orange juice as you can, reserving for another use, and discard the seeds. Chop the orange skin and pulp very finely, mix with the lemon and mango, and reserve (discard any part of the rinds that have not softened).

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift the flour and baking powder together into a mixing bowl. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs until thick and pale, about 4 to 5 minutes. Continue beating while adding the sugar. Stir in the flour mixture just until blended. Gently add the reserved fruit, almonds and infused oil. Pour the batter into a very lightly oiled 9 inch springform pan.

Bake in the oven for about 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack. Run a knife around the inside edge of the pan and let cool for 15 minutes. Release the springform and allow to cool completely before serving. Cut the cake into wedges and serve. Yield: One 9 inch cake.
